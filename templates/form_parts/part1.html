            At Minor League Hacking (MLH) we know the power of hands-on learning first-hand. Every year, more than 0 aspiring technologists around the world participate in MLH events where they learn the skills that help them land jobs, launch startups, and everything in between. You can't learn these necessary skills in most classrooms, which is why so many people take their education into their own hands and join our community every year.
