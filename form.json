      "text": "Hey, there! We're so excited to hear that you're interested in becoming an MLH Fellow in our upcoming batch.\\nAt Major League Hacking (MLH) we know the power of hands-on learning first-hand. Every year, more than 135,000 aspiring technologists around the world participate in MLH events where they learn the skills that help them land jobs, launch startups, and everything in between. You can't learn these necessary skills in most classrooms, which is why so many people take their education into their own hands and join our community every year.\\nThe MLH Fellowship is a collection of programs designed to make learning these skills easy, fun, and fast. By pairing educational and fun content with practice experience, you can learn a lot in a very short period of time. Whether you're looking to build out your initial portfolio of personal projects, polish up a project you're passionate about, or start contributing to Open Source, we have a program for you.\\nThe application takes approximately 30-45 minutes to complete. You can save your work at any time and come back to it in the future.",
